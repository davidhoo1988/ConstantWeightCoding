Generate XCO file:
   CORE Generator input file containing the parameters used to regenerate a
   core.

   * mul_11bits.xco

Generate Implementation Netlist:
   Binary Xilinx implementation netlist files containing the information
   required to implement the module in a Xilinx (R) FPGA.

Generate Instantiation Templates:
   Template files containing code that can be used as a model for instantiating
   a CORE Generator module in a VHDL design.

   * mul_11bits.veo
