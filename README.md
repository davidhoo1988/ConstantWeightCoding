# ConstantWeightCoding
This project implements the Senderier's constant weight coding method. 
Our implementation gives a more compact design by using our own proposals.
CW coding is in particular of interst of McEliece/Niederreiter cryptosystem 
in which a fast converion from messages to vectors of prescribed Hamming 
weight is required. Readers can find details on our CW coding methods in ./paper/IEEEtran/bare_adv.pdf.
